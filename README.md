A formalized proof in Agda of a version of the initiality conjecture for a type theory with
Pi-types, a base type called U, and a dependent type called El. The notion of model is based on
contextual categories.

It requires a recent version of the master branch of Agda (to have the `variable` keyword and some
issues fixed).

The file `expr.agda` contains things about the syntax and the file `contextualcat.agda` contains
things about contextual categories.
