A formalized proof in Agda of a version of the initiality conjecture for a type theory with
Pi-types, a base type called U, and a dependent type called El. The notion of model is based on
contextual categories.

It requires a version of Agda higher than 2.5.4.1 (to have the `variable` keyword), but not too
recent until https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/3306 is fixed.
